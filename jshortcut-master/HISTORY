jshortcut-0.4-oberzalek  September 16, 2010  Oberzalek 64-bit DLLs

  Enhancements:

  * Martin Oberzalek has contributed 64-bit DLLs for ia64 and amd64.
  * Martin also contributed a mechanism whereby if the DLL is not found
    in the PATH or CLASSPATH, the jshortcut jar file is examined to see
    if the appropriate DLL is contained in it.  If so, it is extracted
    to a temporary location, marked for delete-on-exit, and used from there.
    This allows multiple architecture-specific DLLs to be bundled into
    the jar file for easier distribution.

  Other Changes:

  * JShortcut is now being hosted on github, so the latest versions
    will be found there.

jshortcut-0_4  November 15, 2003  Released under LGPL

  Enhancements:

  * The JShellLink.getDirectory method now includes the locations
    "common_programs" and "common_desktopdirectory", corresponding to
    CDISL_COMMON_PROGRAMS and CDISL_COMMON_DESKTOPDIRECTORY, which return
    the All Users locations for Programs and Desktop.  Note that these will
    not work on older versions of Windows.

  Other Changes:

  * JShellLink is now released under the LGPL rather than the GPL.

jshortcut-0_3  September 12, 2003  Use native string encoding

  Enhancements

  * The new setArguments and getArguments methods to JShellLink allow you
    to manipluate the arguments field of the shortcut.

  * The native code now uses a context structure instead of static variables,
    which should make it possible to use JShortcut in a multi-threaded program.

  Bug Fixes:

  * JShortcut now uses the native string encoding to convert between Java
    strings and native strings rather than assuming UTF-8.

===============================================================================

jshortcut-0_2  December 30, 2002  Ability to read existing shortcuts

  Enhancements
  
  * The new methods getIconLocation, getIconIndex, setIconLocation and
    setIconIndex allow viewing and changing the location of the icon for
    a shortcut.

  * The new load() method allows reading an existing shortcut from disk
    into a JShortcut object.

  Bug Fixes

  * Before doing a save() on a shell link, JShortcut now first does a load
    on that shell link, so that any fields not set by the application will
    be preserved in the shell link.

===============================================================================

jshortcut-0_1  November 21, 2002  First release

  Enhancements

  * JShellLink.getDirectory allows getting paths to special folders for
    desktop, personal, programs, program_files.

  * JShellLink allows setting folder, name, description, path,
    workingDirectory.

  * New shortcuts can be created only.
    No capability to read existing shortcuts.
