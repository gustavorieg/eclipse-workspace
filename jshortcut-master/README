JShortcut is a JNI library to allow Java programs to create shortcuts
and menu items on Windows.

For more information, see README.html.

Types of download files:

    jshortcut-X.Y-dist.jar    Self-extracting distribution of version X.Y
    jshortcut-X.Y.jar         Runtime library for version X.Y
    jshortcut_ARCH-X.Y.dll    DLL for version X.Y, architecture ARCH
        ARCH=x86 is the 32-bit Intel architecture.  This is also the
          architecture for the DLL with no architecture in its name.
        ARCH=amd64 is the 64-bit AMD DLL contributed by Oberzalek.
        ARCH=ia64 is the 64-bit Intel Architecture DLL contributed by Oberzalek.

If you want to build jshortcut yourself, download the dist file and
extract it by running the command "java -jar jshortcut-X.Y-dist.jar".
This will also provide you with jshortcut.jar and the 32-bit x86 version of
the DLL, so if that's what you want you don't have to download those
files separately.

If you just want to use jshortcut but don't care about building it,
download the runtime jar file and one or more of the dll files.
In either case, after downloading rename the files to jshortcut.jar
and jshortcut.dll.

The oberzalek jar file includes all three DLLs inside the jar file,
as well as code to extract the appropriate DLL to a temp dir.  If you
download that file, you should be able to use it directly as your jar file
for any of the three platforms.
